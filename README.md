# API_Server_Test
I don't know how to change the name of the Repository. 

### Running the script

Anyways, in order to run the script type:

'mvn spring-boot:run'


### Problems

If there are any problems let me know! Or if you figure it out, write in here how to resolve it!


### Adding Code

I've been copying and pasting from 

[Spring-boot Site](https://adityasridhar.com/posts/how-to-create-simple-rest-apis-with-springboot)


## RESTful API
- /movie: to see a collection of the movies nominated.
